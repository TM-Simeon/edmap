i had a redirect error on attempt to login with the auth_credentials, after specifying
the redirect uri in the credentials, the error persisted. i later found out the port
number was constantly changing, and this was due to the fact that the flow.run_local_server(port=0)
was specified to zero (0). port 0 is a wildcard port that tells the system to find a suitable port
number. unlike most port numbers, port 0 is a reserved port in tcp/ip networking. 
on changing this value to 8080, the redirect error was removed and everything worked
